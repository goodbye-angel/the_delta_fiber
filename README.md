# The Delta Fiber

The Delta Fiber is a yarn cataloging application. Knitters are a weird bunch, and tend to collect lots and lots of yarn over the years without knowing quite what to do with it. It's always waiting for "the right project." This amalgamation of yarn is commonly referred to as a "stash," and frequently the curator of said stash has no idea what's actually in it. This application is a way to catalog all that yarn digitally and keep it organized.

It's called The Delta Fiber because I really like Star Trek Voyager. There are also a couple of other weird Voyager references sprinkled around!

## Technologies Used

The Delta Fiber was built using Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, EJS, HTML, and CSS.

It is hosted online at https://the-delta-fiber.herokuapp.com/yarn.

## Future improvements:
- ability to search by keyword
- drop down menu for "yarn weight"
- ability to change how yarn on index is sorted (alphabetically, by brand, weight, etc)
- more styling

### Author
This application was built with lots of love, caffeine, and yarn by Jaq Dunham as a project for the Web Development Immersive Remote program at General Assembly in December, 2017.
